HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ACT 1974 The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 is designed to protect people and the environment from workplace activities. It places certain duties and responsibilities on employers, employees, self-employed, designers and manufactures. PROVISION & USE OF WORK EQUIPMENT REGULATIONS 1998 (PUWER 98) Work equipment is any machinery, appliance, apparatus, tool or installation for use at work (whether exclusively or not). This includes equipment which employees provide for their own use at work. The scope of work equipment is therefore extremely wide. Machines must be stable when in use; machines have been known to fall over. ROPS (Roll Over Protective Structures) & FOPS (Falling Object Protective Structures) must be in place to provide some protection to the operator in the event of the machine overturning or from small falling objects. Equipment must be capable of being maintained safely. Accidents occur during maintenance thus the risks encountered during such maintenance must be reduced. ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION AND GUIDANCE: Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations (MHSWR) Construction (Design and Management) Regulations (CDM) Vibration at Work Regulations Road Traffic Act HSG 114 \u2013 The safe use of vehicles on construction sites HSG 46 \u2013 Guide for small contractors Plant Safety Group \u2013 Safe use of dumpers Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations The Control of Noise Regulations RISK ASSESSMENTS AND METHOD STATEMENTS Employers are required by law to protect your employees, and others, from harm. Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, the minimum you must do is: \u25cf\u200b Identify what could cause injury or illness in your business (hazards) \u25cf\u200b Decide how likely it is that someone could be harmed and how seriously (the risk) Take action to eliminate the hazard, or if this isn't possible, control the risk. The purpose of a Method Statement when on site is to document given specific instructions on how to SAFELY perform a work-related task. It is the plant operator\u2019s responsibility to COMPLY with the Method Statement. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES In general plant operators are regarded as \u2018safety-critical\u2019 workers, which means their actions with the machine can have significant health & safety consequences for themselves and others. It is essential that all personnel involved in the planning, supervision and carrying out of mobile plant operations are adequately trained and competent for their role.

Familiarise yourself with some of the subject areas that will be included in a site induction. OPERATOR ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES As a \u2018safety critical\u2019 worker, plant operators are required to: \u2714\u200b Only use site plant or equipment if you are trained, competent and have been authorised to do so. \u2714\u200b Only authorised operators should hold vehicle keys. \u2714\u200b You are required to work safely, efficiently and comply with the method statement. \u2714\u200b Be punctual and co-operate with other workers \u2013 this can contribute towards repeat business with the client or principal contractor. Operators should also be trained in the safe operation of the specific machine that they are required to operate, which will include: \u25cf\u200b Layout and operation of the controls. \u25cf\u200b Stability limits. \u25cf\u200b Daily checks and how to do them safely. Always use the operator\u2019s manual for the machine you are operating. This includes safety information, maintenance and information on operation. Good timekeeping, being polite, being safe and doing a good job are all ways of ensuring repeat business with a client or principle contractor. Additional Sources of Information \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b Codes of Practice Site plans / drawings Risk assessments and method statements COSHH Regulations Safety data sheets Load / tare sheets Inspection and reporting forms / procedures Forward Tipping Dumper MAJOR COMPONENTS OF A FORWARD TIPPING DUMPER DIFFERENT TYPES OF DUMPER & SKIPS PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THE MACHINE Unit Always wear gloves when checking engine oil to prevent skin disease and contamination of oil onto the operating controls and the cab. Always ensure the filler cap area is clean and pressure in the system is Hydraulic released before removing the cap. Always use a clean container when System filling the system to prevent contamination. Where possible, plant should be filled up at the end of your shift to prevent Fuel System condensation building up in the tank. Cooling Cooling systems are normally pressurised and removing the cap can allow System hot water to escape with the potential for causing SEVERE burns. Roll Over ROPS provides some protection to the operating position (as far as is Protective reasonably practicable) in the event of an overturn. Structure Falling Where there is the risk of people operating mobile work equipment being Object struck by falling material, falling object protective structures (FOPS) or a Protective manufacturer\u2019s strengthened cab must be fitted to stop any falling material Structures Power \u2013 Oils Restraining Systems Tyres striking the operator. When sitting in an enclosed cab that meets FOPS criteria, a hard hat does not need to be worn. Seat belts must be worn even when the cab door is closed. This is because in the event of a roll over (as far as reasonably practical), it will keep the operator within the confines of the operating seat which may minimise injury. Raised lugs on tyres provide traction / grip for moving, steering and braking in soft mud. If tyres are worn, traction and grip will be severely affected. PRE-OPERATIONAL CHECKS IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANUFACTURERS AND LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 states that employees must take reasonable care of themselves and others who may be affected by their actions. It is a requirement to check that the machine is safe to use prior to using it. The following items must be checked prior to use: PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) Always ensure that you wear the full PPE required for the site that you are working on. \u2714\u200b Head protection \u2714\u200b Foot protection \u2714\u200b High-visibility clothing \u2714\u200b Weather-appropriate clothing \u2714\u200b Hearing protection \u2714\u200b Eye protection \u2714\u200b Gloves SAFELY GET ON AND OFF THE FORWARD TIPPING DUMPER \u2714\u200b Face the machine using the specific steps and handrails provided. \u2714\u200b Maintain 3 points of contact wherever possible. \u2714\u200b Ensure the steps and handrails are clean and clear of debris in your daily checks. \u2714\u200b Ensure the ground you are stepping out onto or walking on is firm and clear of obstructions before existing the cab. Wearing the correct boots can eliminate injuries. Ensure they are laced up fully and worn correctly. PREPARE AND CONFIGURE THE FORWARD TIPPING DUMPER FOR SITE TRAVEL \u2714\u200b Engine cover \u2013 secured. \u2714\u200b Check parking brake \u2013 on. \u2714\u200b Check controls are neutralised. \u2714\u200b Adjust seat for comfort / reach. \u2714\u200b Adjust steering column as appropriate. \u2714\u200b Wear seatbelt \u2013 adjust as required. \u2714\u200b Foot brake \u2013 pressure. VISIBILITY AIDS Always ensure that all mirrors / cameras are correctly fitted, unbroken, clean, and correctly adjusted. Check that ALL mirrors are clean and correctly positioned to provide you with a clear, unobstructed view behind the dumper. PEDESTRIANISED AREAS If you are setting up to work in pedestrianised areas, always take the following into consideration. \u25cf\u200b Always ensure physical segregation of pedestrians from machines and the work \u25cf\u200b Machine movements \u25cf\u200b Noise \u25cf\u200b Fumes TRAVELLING ON A PUBLIC HIGHWAY When travelling on the public highway, the machine must adhere to the following requirements by law: \u2714\u200b The dumper must be registered and taxed as a \u201cspecial vehicle\u201d \u2714\u200b The dumper must have vehicle insurance \u2714\u200b If the dumper can exceed 20 mph it must have a horn in good working condition \u2714\u200b If it can exceed 25 mph it must have a speedometer in good working condition \u2714\u200b It must have brakes that enable it to stop \u2714\u200b It must have lights and indicators The operator must: \u2714\u200b Hold a full UK or approved car license (Category B) \u2714\u200b Be a minimum of 18 years old for vehicles beween 3.5T and 7.5T \u2714\u200b Be a minimum of 21 years old for vehicles exceeding 7.5T (MAM) TOWING EQUIPMENT WITH A DUMPER \u2013 ENHANCED TRAINING Some dumpers have the capability to tow equipment such as small bowsers and compressors. As dumpers are not specifically designed for towing purposes, other methods should be explored before deciding on this purpose. Towing with a dumper requires enhanced training, in addition to the training delivered within the Skills Bootcamp programme. To assist with your knowledge and understanding of this \u2018safety critical\u2019 activity, below outlines some key safety information when towing with a dumper. Should you be asked to tow equipment, you must consider the following points: \u2714\u200b All options have been considered and there no other more suitable machine is available. \u2714\u200b Towing activities are authorised by the manufacturer of the dumper to be used. \u2714\u200b The equipment to be towed does not exceed the specification set by the manufacturer in terms of the weight of the equipment and the downward load imposed on the towing point. \u2714\u200b The towing bracket is compatible with the towing eye on the equipment to be towed. \u2714\u200b You have been trained and are competent to carry out towing activities. \u2714\u200b The correct towing pin for the towing bracket is used and that the safety pin is located correctly in the towing pin. \u2714\u200b Towing balls come in a variety of sizes and where the size of ball differs from the towed equipment\u2019s towing hitch, there is a danger that the hitch can dislodge from the ball and the towed equipment become detached from the dumper. \u2714\u200b The manufacturers handbook should be consulted to ensure a full understanding of the towing restrictions placed by the manufacturer. It should be noted that manufacturers requirements differ between different models from the same manufacturer. \u2714\u200b The towing ability of the dumper may depend on whether the trailer is fitted with an overrun brake or is non-braked. Using an overweight non-braked trailer could cause loss of control during the braking activity. TRAVEL AND MANOEUVRE THE DUMPER When travelling and manoeuvring the dumper, it is important to ensure machine stability to reduce the risk of the dumper becoming stuck or tipping over. When operating a rotating seat dumper, you can change the seat and console position to allow the operator the best viewpoint while travelling, manoeuvring and operating the machine. The entire operating platform rotates 180 degrees. You may have viewed the pre-operational checks video earlier in this workbook, but please scan the QR code to view again. TRAVEL AND MANOEUVRE IN AREAS OF RESTRICTED SPACE Overhead Services It is important that all work near to overhead lines is properly planned and managed to reduce the risk of accidents. The Health and Safety Executive publication \u2018Avoiding danger from overhead power lines\u2019 (GS6) gives valuable information and guidance on how to safely plan and set up work near to overhead power lines. High voltage electricity can arc across large gaps in certain conditions.",

HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ACT 1974 The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 is designed to protect people and the environment from workplace activities. It places certain duties and responsibilities on employers, employees, self-employed, designers and manufactures. PROVISION & USE OF WORK EQUIPMENT REGULATIONS 1998 (PUWER 98) Work equipment is any machinery, appliance, apparatus, tool or installation for use at work (whether exclusively or not). This includes equipment which employees provide for their own use at work. The scope of work equipment is therefore extremely wide. Machines must be stable when in use; machines have been known to fall over. ROPS (Roll Over Protective Structures) & FOPS (Falling Object Protective Structures) must be in place to provide some protection to the operator in the event of the machine overturning or from small falling objects. Equipment must be capable of being maintained safely. Accidents occur during maintenance thus the risks encountered during such maintenance must be reduced. ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION AND GUIDANCE: Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations (MHSWR) Construction (Design and Management) Regulations (CDM) Vibration at Work Regulations Road Traffic Act HSG 114 \u2013 The safe use of vehicles on construction sites HSG 46 \u2013 Guide for small contractors Plant Safety Group \u2013 Safe use of dumpers Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations The Control of Noise Regulations RISK ASSESSMENTS AND METHOD STATEMENTS Employers are required by law to protect your employees, and others, from harm. Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, the minimum you must do is: \u25cf\u200b Identify what could cause injury or illness in your business (hazards) \u25cf\u200b Decide how likely it is that someone could be harmed and how seriously (the risk) Take action to eliminate the hazard, or if this isn't possible, control the risk. The purpose of a Method Statement when on site is to document given specific instructions on how to SAFELY perform a work-related task. It is the plant operator\u2019s responsibility to COMPLY with the Method Statement. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES In general plant operators are regarded as \u2018safety-critical\u2019 workers, which means their actions with the machine can have significant health & safety consequences for themselves and others. It is essential that all personnel involved in the planning, supervision and carrying out of mobile plant operations are adequately trained and competent for their role. SITE INDUCTION \u25cf\u200b Access and egress \u25cf\u200b Safety signs and signals \u25cf\u200b Accident reporting \u25cf\u200b Confined spaces \u25cf\u200b Emergency procedures \u25cf\u200b Buried services \u25cf\u200b Reporting structure \u25cf\u200b Contamination \u25cf\u200b PPE/RPE requirements \u25cf\u200b Electricity \u25cf\u200b Welfare facilities \u25cf\u200b Lifting operations \u25cf\u200b Reporting procedures \u25cf\u200b Working from/at height \u25cf\u200b Site Layout \u25cf\u200b Waste disposal \u25cf\u200b Traffic Routes \u25cf\u200b Smoking policy \u25cf\u200b Restricted/prohibited areas When starting work on a new site you will undergo a site induction. Familiarise yourself with some of the subject areas that will be included in a site induction. OPERATOR ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES As a \u2018safety critical\u2019 worker, plant operators are required to: \u2714\u200b Only use site plant or equipment if you are trained, competent and have been authorised to do so. \u2714\u200b Only authorised operators should hold vehicle keys. \u2714\u200b You are required to work safely, efficiently and comply with the method statement. \u2714\u200b Be punctual and co-operate with other workers \u2013 this can contribute towards repeat business with the client or principal contractor. Operators should also be trained in the safe operation of the specific machine that they are required to operate, which will include: \u25cf\u200b Layout and operation of the controls. \u25cf\u200b Stability limits. \u25cf\u200b Daily checks and how to do them safely. Always use the operator\u2019s manual for the machine you are operating. This includes safety information, maintenance and information on operation. Good timekeeping, being polite, being safe and doing a good job are all ways of ensuring repeat business with a client or principle contractor. Additional Sources of Information \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b Codes of Practice Site plans / drawings Risk assessments and method statements COSHH Regulations Safety data sheets Load / tare sheets Inspection and reporting forms / procedures Forward Tipping Dumper MAJOR COMPONENTS OF A FORWARD TIPPING DUMPER DIFFERENT TYPES OF DUMPER & SKIPS PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THE MACHINE Unit Always wear gloves when checking engine oil to prevent skin disease and contamination of oil onto the operating controls and the cab. Always ensure the filler cap area is clean and pressure in the system is Hydraulic released before removing the cap. Always use a clean container when System filling the system to prevent contamination. Where possible, plant should be filled up at the end of your shift to prevent Fuel System condensation building up in the tank. Cooling Cooling systems are normally pressurised and removing the cap can allow System hot water to escape with the potential for causing SEVERE burns. Roll Over ROPS provides some protection to the operating position (as far as is Protective reasonably practicable) in the event of an overturn. Structure Falling Where there is the risk of people operating mobile work equipment being Object struck by falling material, falling object protective structures (FOPS) or a Protective manufacturer\u2019s strengthened cab must be fitted to stop any falling material Structures Power \u2013 Oils Restraining Systems Tyres striking the operator. When sitting in an enclosed cab that meets FOPS criteria, a hard hat does not need to be worn. Seat belts must be worn even when the cab door is closed. This is because in the event of a roll over (as far as reasonably practical), it will keep the operator within the confines of the operating seat which may minimise injury. Raised lugs on tyres provide traction / grip for moving, steering and braking in soft mud. If tyres are worn, traction and grip will be severely affected. PRE-OPERATIONAL CHECKS IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANUFACTURERS AND LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 states that employees must take reasonable care of themselves and others who may be affected by their actions. It is a requirement to check that the machine is safe to use prior to using it. The following items must be checked prior to use: PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) Always ensure that you wear the full PPE required for the site that you are working on. \u2714\u200b Head protection \u2714\u200b Foot protection \u2714\u200b High-visibility clothing \u2714\u200b Weather-appropriate clothing \u2714\u200b Hearing protection \u2714\u200b Eye protection \u2714\u200b Gloves SAFELY GET ON AND OFF THE FORWARD TIPPING DUMPER \u2714\u200b Face the machine using the specific steps and handrails provided. \u2714\u200b Maintain 3 points of contact wherever possible. \u2714\u200b Ensure the steps and handrails are clean and clear of debris in your daily checks. \u2714\u200b Ensure the ground you are stepping out onto or walking on is firm and clear of obstructions before existing the cab.

Additional Sources of Information \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b Codes of Practice Site plans / drawings Risk assessments and method statements COSHH Regulations Safety data sheets Load / tare sheets Inspection and reporting forms / procedures Forward Tipping Dumper MAJOR COMPONENTS OF A FORWARD TIPPING DUMPER DIFFERENT TYPES OF DUMPER & SKIPS PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THE MACHINE Unit Always wear gloves when checking engine oil to prevent skin disease and contamination of oil onto the operating controls and the cab. Always ensure the filler cap area is clean and pressure in the system is Hydraulic released before removing the cap. Always use a clean container when System filling the system to prevent contamination. Where possible, plant should be filled up at the end of your shift to prevent Fuel System condensation building up in the tank. Cooling Cooling systems are normally pressurised and removing the cap can allow System hot water to escape with the potential for causing SEVERE burns. Roll Over ROPS provides some protection to the operating position (as far as is Protective reasonably practicable) in the event of an overturn. Structure Falling Where there is the risk of people operating mobile work equipment being Object struck by falling material, falling object protective structures (FOPS) or a Protective manufacturer\u2019s strengthened cab must be fitted to stop any falling material Structures Power \u2013 Oils Restraining Systems Tyres striking the operator. When sitting in an enclosed cab that meets FOPS criteria, a hard hat does not need to be worn. Seat belts must be worn even when the cab door is closed. This is because in the event of a roll over (as far as reasonably practical), it will keep the operator within the confines of the operating seat which may minimise injury. Raised lugs on tyres provide traction / grip for moving, steering and braking in soft mud. If tyres are worn, traction and grip will be severely affected. PRE-OPERATIONAL CHECKS IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANUFACTURERS AND LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 states that employees must take reasonable care of themselves and others who may be affected by their actions. It is a requirement to check that the machine is safe to use prior to using it. The following items must be checked prior to use: PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) Always ensure that you wear the full PPE required for the site that you are working on. \u2714\u200b Head protection \u2714\u200b Foot protection \u2714\u200b High-visibility clothing \u2714\u200b Weather-appropriate clothing \u2714\u200b Hearing protection \u2714\u200b Eye protection \u2714\u200b Gloves SAFELY GET ON AND OFF THE FORWARD TIPPING DUMPER \u2714\u200b Face the machine using the specific steps and handrails provided. \u2714\u200b Maintain 3 points of contact wherever possible. \u2714\u200b Ensure the steps and handrails are clean and clear of debris in your daily checks. \u2714\u200b Ensure the ground you are stepping out onto or walking on is firm and clear of obstructions before existing the cab. Wearing the correct boots can eliminate injuries. Ensure they are laced up fully and worn correctly. PREPARE AND CONFIGURE THE FORWARD TIPPING DUMPER FOR SITE TRAVEL \u2714\u200b Engine cover \u2013 secured. \u2714\u200b Check parking brake \u2013 on. \u2714\u200b Check controls are neutralised. \u2714\u200b Adjust seat for comfort / reach. \u2714\u200b Adjust steering column as appropriate. \u2714\u200b Wear seatbelt \u2013 adjust as required. \u2714\u200b Foot brake \u2013 pressure. VISIBILITY AIDS Always ensure that all mirrors / cameras are correctly fitted, unbroken, clean, and correctly adjusted. Check that ALL mirrors are clean and correctly positioned to provide you with a clear, unobstructed view behind the dumper. PEDESTRIANISED AREAS If you are setting up to work in pedestrianised areas, always take the following into consideration. \u25cf\u200b Always ensure physical segregation of pedestrians from machines and the work \u25cf\u200b Machine movements \u25cf\u200b Noise \u25cf\u200b Fumes TRAVELLING ON A PUBLIC HIGHWAY When travelling on the public highway, the machine must adhere to the following requirements by law: \u2714\u200b The dumper must be registered and taxed as a \u201cspecial vehicle\u201d \u2714\u200b The dumper must have vehicle insurance \u2714\u200b If the dumper can exceed 20 mph it must have a horn in good working condition \u2714\u200b If it can exceed 25 mph it must have a speedometer in good working condition \u2714\u200b It must have brakes that enable it to stop \u2714\u200b It must have lights and indicators The operator must: \u2714\u200b Hold a full UK or approved car license (Category B) \u2714\u200b Be a minimum of 18 years old for vehicles beween 3.5T and 7.5T \u2714\u200b Be a minimum of 21 years old for vehicles exceeding 7.5T (MAM) TOWING EQUIPMENT WITH A DUMPER \u2013 ENHANCED TRAINING Some dumpers have the capability to tow equipment such as small bowsers and compressors. As dumpers are not specifically designed for towing purposes, other methods should be explored before deciding on this purpose. Towing with a dumper requires enhanced training, in addition to the training delivered within the Skills Bootcamp programme. To assist with your knowledge and understanding of this \u2018safety critical\u2019 activity, below outlines some key safety information when towing with a dumper. Should you be asked to tow equipment, you must consider the following points: \u2714\u200b All options have been considered and there no other more suitable machine is available. \u2714\u200b Towing activities are authorised by the manufacturer of the dumper to be used. \u2714\u200b The equipment to be towed does not exceed the specification set by the manufacturer in terms of the weight of the equipment and the downward load imposed on the towing point. \u2714\u200b The towing bracket is compatible with the towing eye on the equipment to be towed. \u2714\u200b You have been trained and are competent to carry out towing activities. \u2714\u200b The correct towing pin for the towing bracket is used and that the safety pin is located correctly in the towing pin. \u2714\u200b Towing balls come in a variety of sizes and where the size of ball differs from the towed equipment\u2019s towing hitch, there is a danger that the hitch can dislodge from the ball and the towed equipment become detached from the dumper. \u2714\u200b The manufacturers handbook should be consulted to ensure a full understanding of the towing restrictions placed by the manufacturer. It should be noted that manufacturers requirements differ between different models from the same manufacturer. \u2714\u200b The towing ability of the dumper may depend on whether the trailer is fitted with an overrun brake or is non-braked. Using an overweight non-braked trailer could cause loss of control during the braking activity. TRAVEL AND MANOEUVRE THE DUMPER When travelling and manoeuvring the dumper, it is important to ensure machine stability to reduce the risk of the dumper becoming stuck or tipping over. When operating a rotating seat dumper, you can change the seat and console position to allow the operator the best viewpoint while travelling, manoeuvring and operating the machine. The entire operating platform rotates 180 degrees. You may have viewed the pre-operational checks video earlier in this workbook, but please scan the QR code to view again. TRAVEL AND MANOEUVRE IN AREAS OF RESTRICTED SPACE Overhead Services It is important that all work near to overhead lines is properly planned and managed to reduce the risk of accidents. The Health and Safety Executive publication \u2018Avoiding danger from overhead power lines\u2019 (GS6) gives valuable information and guidance on how to safely plan and set up work near to overhead power lines. High voltage electricity can arc across large gaps in certain conditions. OPERATING IN CONFINED AREAS The Spillard Human Detection System identifies only human form through deep intelligent mapping. It aims to: \u2714\u200b Warn operators and pedestrians of potential risks of collision. \u2714\u200b Improve operators all around awareness of their surroundings. \u2714\u200b Detect human form whilst ignoring ever changing backgrounds. \u2714\u200b Reduce risk whilst improving the operator and pedestrian interaction. The human detection system is an aid to safety only. It must be used in addition to the site\u2019s safe system of work. Safety Shield AI Collision Avoidance Technology Safety Shield is an advanced AI human form recognition safety system. The system cleverly integrates AI human form recognition (HFR) with strategically placed HD cameras. The in-cab LED visual and audio alert warns the driver of a pedestrian in proximity. An additional module can be fitted for an external alarm and Digital Thumbs Up LED display to allow site personal to approach the machine safely and from the correct direction. The Safety Shield system scans and detects all objects around it, but the smart technology will only alert the operator to pedestrians and vulnerable site personnel entering the danger recognition zones. By filtering out objects other than humans, the Safety Shield system reduces unnecessary distractions for the plant operator. CONDUCT ALL NECESSARY SAFETY CHECKS AT THE LOADING AND DISCHARGING AREA Prior to setting up for work, the operator must conduct safety checks at the work area to identify any potential hazards. ENSURE LOAD INTEGRITY/ SECURITY Prior to transporting the load, the following actions must be taken: \u2022\u200b \u2022\u200b \u2022\u200b \u2022\u200b Ensure the load is secured and stable. Check your travel route. Arrange assistance for observation and visibility. Never overload the skip. Overloading obscures the operator\u2019s view and significantly reduces visibility. This increases the hazards associated with the people, plant interface. It is the dumper operator responsibility to determine maximum load. Always refer to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. LOADING, TRANSPORTING AND DISCHARGING DIFFERENT MATERIALS Denser materials: may overload your tyres and may stick to the body when tipping. You may need to tip at different locations. Semi-Fluid materials: may spill during travel. Spoil: this material should be segregated for re-use on or off-site, where possible. It must be placed a minimum distance of the depth of the trench away from the excavation to prevent collapse. DISCHARGING LOADS A banksman should be used if deemed necessary in the risk assessment. Cameras are there as a visual aid when approaching the tipping area / stop block. Stop blocks are used to indicate the stopping point of the dumper and to prevent the machine from overrunning into the trench. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS OF MACHINE USE The main types of pollution associated with construction operations are: \u25cf\u200b Air pollution \u25cf\u200b Water pollution \u25cf\u200b Noise pollution There are various pollution prevention strategies that can be used. Operators can minimise their effect on the environment by using the machine efficiently: \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b Lower engine speeds where possible. Ensure there is no spillage of fluids. Keep the machine well maintained. Ensure prior planning of the work task. LOADING/ UNLOADING PROCEDURES FOR MACHINE TRANSPORTATION The transporter driver is responsible for loading operations. The following checks should be made before loading commences: \u2714\u200b Ground support \u2714\u200b Ramp condition \u2714\u200b Overhead and other hazards \u2714\u200b Positioning on trailer \u2714\u200b Direction of travel The following process should be followed when loading the transporter: \u2714\u200b Remove any dirt or debris from the trailer. \u2714\u200b Check parking brake. \u2714\u200b Check trailer bodywork for signs of damage. \u2714\u200b Position loading ramps securely on the transporter. \u2714\u200b Stop the engine and secure the machine. \u2714\u200b Chock wheels to prevent movement. \u2714\u200b Engage chassis locking bar. \u2714\u200b Secure to the trailer. \u2714\u200b Ensure legal load (height/weight of trailer) Exclusion zone Always ensure an exclusion zone is in place prior to commencing the loading activity. In areas of no space restrictions, the exclusion zone must: \u25cf\u200b Always be clear of personnel. \u25cf\u200b Should have a minimum clearance of at least the height of the highest point of the machine. \u25cf\u200b Sites with space restrictions will require a risk assessment and driver briefing of the site-specific measures and procedures (e.g. motorways with restricted space). END OF WORK AND SHUT DOWN PROCEDURES When parking the machine at the end of the work period, you must follow the full shut down procedure. Consider where you park your machine. DO NOT park your machine on site roads, pedestrian routes, soft/wet/steep ground, blocking access / egress routes from buildings.

HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ACT 1974 The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 is designed to protect people and the environment from workplace activities. It places certain duties and responsibilities on employers, employees, self-employed, designers and manufactures. PROVISION & USE OF WORK EQUIPMENT REGULATIONS 1998 (PUWER 98) Work equipment is any machinery, appliance, apparatus, tool or installation for use at work (whether exclusively or not). This includes equipment which employees provide for their own use at work. The scope of work equipment is therefore extremely wide. Machines must be stable when in use; machines have been known to fall over. ROPS (Roll Over Protective Structures) & FOPS (Falling Object Protective Structures) must be in place to provide some protection to the operator in the event of the machine overturning or from small falling objects. Equipment must be capable of being maintained safely. Accidents occur during maintenance thus the risks encountered during such maintenance must be reduced. ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION AND GUIDANCE: Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations (MHSWR) Construction (Design and Management) Regulations (CDM) Vibration at Work Regulations Road Traffic Act HSG 114 \u2013 The safe use of vehicles on construction sites HSG 46 \u2013 Guide for small contractors Plant Safety Group \u2013 Safe use of dumpers Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations The Control of Noise Regulations RISK ASSESSMENTS AND METHOD STATEMENTS Employers are required by law to protect your employees, and others, from harm. Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, the minimum you must do is: \u25cf\u200b Identify what could cause injury or illness in your business (hazards) \u25cf\u200b Decide how likely it is that someone could be harmed and how seriously (the risk) Take action to eliminate the hazard, or if this isn't possible, control the risk. The purpose of a Method Statement when on site is to document given specific instructions on how to SAFELY perform a work-related task. It is the plant operator\u2019s responsibility to COMPLY with the Method Statement. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES In general plant operators are regarded as \u2018safety-critical\u2019 workers, which means their actions with the machine can have significant health & safety consequences for themselves and others.

Operators should also be trained in the safe operation of the specific machine that they are required to operate, which will include: \u25cf\u200b Layout and operation of the controls. \u25cf\u200b Stability limits. \u25cf\u200b Daily checks and how to do them safely. Always use the operator\u2019s manual for the machine you are operating. This includes safety information, maintenance and information on operation. Good timekeeping, being polite, being safe and doing a good job are all ways of ensuring repeat business with a client or principle contractor. Additional Sources of Information \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b Codes of Practice Site plans / drawings Risk assessments and method statements COSHH Regulations Safety data sheets Load / tare sheets Inspection and reporting forms / procedures Forward Tipping Dumper MAJOR COMPONENTS OF A FORWARD TIPPING DUMPER DIFFERENT TYPES OF DUMPER & SKIPS PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THE MACHINE Unit Always wear gloves when checking engine oil to prevent skin disease and contamination of oil onto the operating controls and the cab. Always ensure the filler cap area is clean and pressure in the system is Hydraulic released before removing the cap. Always use a clean container when System filling the system to prevent contamination. Where possible, plant should be filled up at the end of your shift to prevent Fuel System condensation building up in the tank. Cooling Cooling systems are normally pressurised and removing the cap can allow System hot water to escape with the potential for causing SEVERE burns. Roll Over ROPS provides some protection to the operating position (as far as is Protective reasonably practicable) in the event of an overturn. Structure Falling Where there is the risk of people operating mobile work equipment being Object struck by falling material, falling object protective structures (FOPS) or a Protective manufacturer\u2019s strengthened cab must be fitted to stop any falling material Structures Power \u2013 Oils Restraining Systems Tyres striking the operator. When sitting in an enclosed cab that meets FOPS criteria, a hard hat does not need to be worn. Seat belts must be worn even when the cab door is closed. This is because in the event of a roll over (as far as reasonably practical), it will keep the operator within the confines of the operating seat which may minimise injury. Raised lugs on tyres provide traction / grip for moving, steering and braking in soft mud. If tyres are worn, traction and grip will be severely affected. PRE-OPERATIONAL CHECKS IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANUFACTURERS AND LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 states that employees must take reasonable care of themselves and others who may be affected by their actions. It is a requirement to check that the machine is safe to use prior to using it.

As dumpers are not specifically designed for towing purposes, other methods should be explored before deciding on this purpose. Towing with a dumper requires enhanced training, in addition to the training delivered within the Skills Bootcamp programme. To assist with your knowledge and understanding of this \u2018safety critical\u2019 activity, below outlines some key safety information when towing with a dumper. Should you be asked to tow equipment, you must consider the following points: \u2714\u200b All options have been considered and there no other more suitable machine is available. \u2714\u200b Towing activities are authorised by the manufacturer of the dumper to be used. \u2714\u200b The equipment to be towed does not exceed the specification set by the manufacturer in terms of the weight of the equipment and the downward load imposed on the towing point. \u2714\u200b The towing bracket is compatible with the towing eye on the equipment to be towed. \u2714\u200b You have been trained and are competent to carry out towing activities. \u2714\u200b The correct towing pin for the towing bracket is used and that the safety pin is located correctly in the towing pin. \u2714\u200b Towing balls come in a variety of sizes and where the size of ball differs from the towed equipment\u2019s towing hitch, there is a danger that the hitch can dislodge from the ball and the towed equipment become detached from the dumper. \u2714\u200b The manufacturers handbook should be consulted to ensure a full understanding of the towing restrictions placed by the manufacturer. It should be noted that manufacturers requirements differ between different models from the same manufacturer. \u2714\u200b The towing ability of the dumper may depend on whether the trailer is fitted with an overrun brake or is non-braked. Using an overweight non-braked trailer could cause loss of control during the braking activity. ",

HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ACT 1974 The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 is designed to protect people and the environment from workplace activities. It places certain duties and responsibilities on employers, employees, self-employed, designers and manufactures. PROVISION & USE OF WORK EQUIPMENT REGULATIONS 1998 (PUWER 98) Work equipment is any machinery, appliance, apparatus, tool or installation for use at work (whether exclusively or not). This includes equipment which employees provide for their own use at work. The scope of work equipment is therefore extremely wide. Machines must be stable when in use; machines have been known to fall over. ROPS (Roll Over Protective Structures) & FOPS (Falling Object Protective Structures) must be in place to provide some protection to the operator in the event of the machine overturning or from small falling objects. Equipment must be capable of being maintained safely. Accidents occur during maintenance thus the risks encountered during such maintenance must be reduced.

HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ACT 1974 The Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 is designed to protect people and the environment from workplace activities. It places certain duties and responsibilities on employers, employees, self-employed, designers and manufactures. PROVISION & USE OF WORK EQUIPMENT REGULATIONS 1998 (PUWER 98) Work equipment is any machinery, appliance, apparatus, tool or installation for use at work (whether exclusively or not). This includes equipment which employees provide for their own use at work. The scope of work equipment is therefore extremely wide. Machines must be stable when in use; machines have been known to fall over. ROPS (Roll Over Protective Structures) & FOPS (Falling Object Protective Structures) must be in place to provide some protection to the operator in the event of the machine overturning or from small falling objects. Equipment must be capable of being maintained safely. Accidents occur during maintenance thus the risks encountered during such maintenance must be reduced. ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION AND GUIDANCE: Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations (MHSWR) Construction (Design and Management) Regulations (CDM) Vibration at Work Regulations Road Traffic Act HSG 114 \u2013 The safe use of vehicles on construction sites HSG 46 \u2013 Guide for small contractors Plant Safety Group \u2013 Safe use of dumpers Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations The Control of Noise Regulations RISK ASSESSMENTS AND METHOD STATEMENTS Employers are required by law to protect your employees, and others, from harm. Under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, the minimum you must do is: \u25cf\u200b Identify what could cause injury or illness in your business (hazards) \u25cf\u200b Decide how likely it is that someone could be harmed and how seriously (the risk) Take action to eliminate the hazard, or if this isn't possible, control the risk. The purpose of a Method Statement when on site is to document given specific instructions on how to SAFELY perform a work-related task. It is the plant operator\u2019s responsibility to COMPLY with the Method Statement. SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES In general plant operators are regarded as \u2018safety-critical\u2019 workers, which means their actions with the machine can have significant health & safety consequences for themselves and others.

TRAVEL AND MANOEUVRE IN AREAS OF RESTRICTED SPACE Overhead Services It is important that all work near to overhead lines is properly planned and managed to reduce the risk of accidents. The Health and Safety Executive publication \u2018Avoiding danger from overhead power lines\u2019 (GS6) gives valuable information and guidance on how to safely plan and set up work near to overhead power lines. High voltage electricity can arc across large gaps in certain conditions. OPERATING IN CONFINED AREAS The Spillard Human Detection System identifies only human form through deep intelligent mapping. It aims to: \u2714\u200b Warn operators and pedestrians of potential risks of collision. \u2714\u200b Improve operators all around awareness of their surroundings. \u2714\u200b Detect human form whilst ignoring ever changing backgrounds. \u2714\u200b Reduce risk whilst improving the operator and pedestrian interaction. The human detection system is an aid to safety only. It must be used in addition to the site\u2019s safe system of work. Safety Shield AI Collision Avoidance Technology Safety Shield is an advanced AI human form recognition safety system. The system cleverly integrates AI human form recognition (HFR) with strategically placed HD cameras. The in-cab LED visual and audio alert warns the driver of a pedestrian in proximity. An additional module can be fitted for an external alarm and Digital Thumbs Up LED display to allow site personal to approach the machine safely and from the correct direction. The Safety Shield system scans and detects all objects around it, but the smart technology will only alert the operator to pedestrians and vulnerable site personnel entering the danger recognition zones. By filtering out objects other than humans, the Safety Shield system reduces unnecessary distractions for the plant operator. CONDUCT ALL NECESSARY SAFETY CHECKS AT THE LOADING AND DISCHARGING AREA Prior to setting up for work, the operator must conduct safety checks at the work area to identify any potential hazards. ENSURE LOAD INTEGRITY/ SECURITY Prior to transporting the load, the following actions must be taken: \u2022\u200b \u2022\u200b \u2022\u200b \u2022\u200b Ensure the load is secured and stable. Check your travel route. Arrange assistance for observation and visibility. Never overload the skip. Overloading obscures the operator\u2019s view and significantly reduces visibility. This increases the hazards associated with the people, plant interface. It is the dumper operator responsibility to determine maximum load. Always refer to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. LOADING, TRANSPORTING AND DISCHARGING DIFFERENT MATERIALS Denser materials: may overload your tyres and may stick to the body when tipping. You may need to tip at different locations. Semi-Fluid materials: may spill during travel. Spoil: this material should be segregated for re-use on or off-site, where possible. It must be placed a minimum distance of the depth of the trench away from the excavation to prevent collapse. DISCHARGING LOADS A banksman should be used if deemed necessary in the risk assessment. Cameras are there as a visual aid when approaching the tipping area / stop block. Stop blocks are used to indicate the stopping point of the dumper and to prevent the machine from overrunning into the trench. ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS OF MACHINE USE The main types of pollution associated with construction operations are: \u25cf\u200b Air pollution \u25cf\u200b Water pollution \u25cf\u200b Noise pollution There are various pollution prevention strategies that can be used. Operators can minimise their effect on the environment by using the machine efficiently: \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b \u25cf\u200b Lower engine speeds where possible. Ensure there is no spillage of fluids. Keep the machine well maintained. Ensure prior planning of the work task.
